### **`src/__init__.py`**

```python
from flask import Flask
from src.config import get_config

def create_app(config_name='development'):
    app = Flask(__name__)
    
    # Load configuration based on environment
    app.config.from_object(get_config(config_name))
    
    # Register blueprints, if any
    # from src.blueprints.example import example_blueprint
    # app.register_blueprint(example_blueprint)
    
    # Set up any extensions or additional setup
    # Initialize extensions like SQLAlchemy, Migrate, etc.
    
    return app
```

### Description:
- **Package Initialization**: The presence of `__init__.py` allows the `src` directory to be treated as a Python package.
- **`create_app` Function**: This function initializes and configures the Flask application. It sets up the app according to the specified environment configuration (`development`, `testing`, `production`).
- **Configuration**: Loads the configuration settings from the `config.py` file based on the provided environment name.
- **Blueprints and Extensions**: Provides a placeholder for registering blueprints (modular components of your Flask app) and initializing any Flask extensions you might use (like SQLAlchemy or Flask-Migrate).

### Usage:
1. **Creating the App**:
   When running the application, you'll use the `create_app` function to set up the Flask application instance. For example, you might modify `src/main.py` to use this function:
   ```python
   from src import create_app

   app = create_app('development')
   
   if __name__ == '__main__':
       app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)
   ```

2. **Extensions and Blueprints**:
   - **Register Blueprints**: You can register blueprints for modular components by importing them and calling `app.register_blueprint`.
   - **Initialize Extensions**: Initialize any Flask extensions (like database connections) in this file or in their own respective modules.

### Benefits:
- **Modular Design**: Encourages a modular approach by allowing the app setup to be encapsulated in a function, making it easier to manage and test.
- **Configuration Flexibility**: Supports different environments by allowing you to specify the configuration name, facilitating a cleaner setup for development, testing, and production.
- **Extension Management**: Provides a centralized place to initialize and configure extensions and other components, keeping your main application code organized.

Including an `__init__.py` file with a `create_app` function helps structure your Flask application in a scalable and maintainable way, especially as your project grows and you incorporate more features and components.
