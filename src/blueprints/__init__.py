### **`src/blueprints/__init__.py`**

```python
from flask import Blueprint

# Import blueprints
from src.routes import user_blueprint

def register_blueprints(app):
    """Register all blueprints."""
    app.register_blueprint(user_blueprint, url_prefix='/api')

# This function can be expanded to register more blueprints as needed
```

### Description:
- **`register_blueprints` Function**: Registers all blueprints with the Flask application. In this example, the `user_blueprint` is registered with a URL prefix (`/api`), so all routes defined in the `user_blueprint` will be prefixed with `/api`.
- **Modularity**: This file allows you to centralize blueprint registration, making it easy to manage and extend your application's routing structure.

### Usage:
1. **Import and Use in Application Setup**:
   In your `create_app` function or main application setup, call `register_blueprints` to ensure all blueprints are registered:
   ```python
   from src.blueprints import register_blueprints

   def create_app(config_name='development'):
       app = Flask(__name__)
       app.config.from_object(get_config(config_name))
       
       # Register blueprints
       register_blueprints(app)
       
       return app
   ```

2. **Adding More Blueprints**:
   As your application grows, you can add more blueprints by creating additional modules and importing them into `src/blueprints/__init__.py`, then registering them in the `register_blueprints` function.

### Benefits:
- **Centralized Blueprint Management**: Provides a single place to manage and register all blueprints, making your code more organized and easier to manage.
- **Scalability**: Makes it simple to add new blueprints and modularize different parts of your application as it grows.
- **Maintainability**: Keeps your application setup clean and separates concerns, improving code readability and maintainability.

Including a `blueprints/__init__.py` file helps you manage and organize blueprints in a modular way, improving the structure and scalability of your Flask application.
